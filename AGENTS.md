- **Accessibility by design**: We create inclusive, accessible solutions that consider the digital divide and diverse user needs
- **Partnerships over consulting**: We co-create progress with our partners rather than providing traditional consulting services

### Focus Areas
1. **Healthcare**: Human-centered approach to addressing pain points in care, systems, and technologies
2. **Public Interest**: Empathy-led design to center diverse public needs and improve government processes
3. **Veterans Services**: Dedicated to streamlining access to support and services for Veteran communities

- **Cross-functional teams**: Diverse expertise working toward common goals (designers, content strategists, engineers, product managers)
- **Open-source technology**: Leverage open-source solutions to deliver custom products that change lives
- **API-driven architectures**: Modern system integrations and cloud-native solutions
- **DevSecOps**: Security-first development and deployment practices

## Repository Context

### Template Purpose
This repository template is designed for technology challenges and collaborative projects. It includes pre-configured GitHub features to support structured development workflows from day one.

### Included Features
- **Issue Templates**: Structured formats for bug reports, user stories, and human-centered design (HCD) deliverables
- **Pull Request Template**: Comprehensive checklist including code quality, testing, documentation, and security considerations
- **GitHub Workflow Integration**: Templates configured to support agile development and collaboration

## LLM Guidelines and Rules

### Professional Communication Standards
- **No emojis**: Maintain professional tone in all communications, documentation, and code comments
- **Clear, concise language**: Use straightforward language that is accessible to diverse audiences
- **Inclusive terminology**: Use inclusive language that reflects Coforma's commitment to diversity and accessibility
- **Government-appropriate tone**: Remember that many projects serve government and public sector clients

### Code Quality Standards
- **Accessibility first**: Ensure all code follows WCAG 2.2 guidelines and accessibility best practices
- **Security by design**: Consider security implications at every step of development
- **Documentation**: Thoroughly document code, particularly complex or hard-to-understand sections
- **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing strategies (unit, integration, accessibility)
- **Code style consistency**: Follow established linting and formatting standards for the project

### Collaboration Principles
- **User-centered approach**: Always consider the end user impact of technical decisions
- **Cross-functional thinking**: Consider how changes affect design, content, accessibility, and user experience
- **Ethical considerations**: Evaluate whether technical choices align with doing good and avoiding harm
- **Iterative improvement**: Favor incremental, well-tested changes over large refactors

### Issue and PR Management
- **Use provided templates**: Always use the structured issue and PR templates
- **Link issues to PRs**: Connect pull requests to relevant issues using the "Fixes #(issue)" format
- **Comprehensive PR descriptions**: Include context, testing instructions, and impact assessment
- **Review checklist compliance**: Ensure all checklist items in PR template are addressed

### Documentation Standards
- **User-focused documentation**: Write documentation that serves the end user, not just developers
- **Accessibility in documentation**: Ensure documentation is accessible to users with disabilities
- **Maintenance notes**: Include information about ongoing maintenance and update requirements
- **Decision records**: Document significant architectural and design decisions

## Project-Specific Customization

### Common Challenge Patterns

When working on tech challenges using this template, consider these common requirements:

#### Assessment Criteria
- **Functionality**: Does the solution solve the stated problem effectively?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, documented, and maintainable?
- **User Experience**: Is the solution accessible and user-friendly?
- **Technical Approach**: Are technical decisions well-reasoned and appropriate?
- **Documentation**: Is the solution well-documented for users and maintainers?

#### Best Practices for Tech Challenges
- **README-driven development**: Start with a clear README explaining the problem and approach
- **Incremental commits**: Make frequent, well-described commits showing development progression
- **Test coverage**: Include appropriate testing to demonstrate code quality
- **Deployment readiness**: Ensure the solution can be easily run and evaluated
- **Assumptions documentation**: Clearly document any assumptions made during development
